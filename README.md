# ExcelRound

You probably shouldnâ€™t use this unless you need to replicate something
done in Excel.

``` r
devtools::install_github("mps9506/ExcelRound")
```

``` r
# IEEE / IEC rounding: -2  0  0  2  2  4  4
round(.5 + -2:4)
#> [1] -2  0  0  2  2  4  4
```

``` r
library(ExcelRound)
## Expect -2 -1 1 2 3 4 5
xl_round(.5 + -2:4)
#> [1] -2 -1  1  2  3  4  5
```

Note that this function adds a very small amount to `x` which scales
with the number of digits to the left of the decimal point. It is
possible that rounding might be incorrect above 1E15 or 1E-15. See
<https://stackoverflow.com/a/59933065/4488436> for details.

``` r
devtools::test(reporter = "summary")
#> Loading ExcelRound
#> Testing ExcelRound
#> xl_rounds up from 5: .
#> xl_rounds down from 4: .
#> 
#> == DONE =====================================================
